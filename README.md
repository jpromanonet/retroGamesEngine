### Just add the retroGameEngine.h file to your project and start using it, i'm going to upload some examples so other developers could make an easier implementation.

It's cross platform, which means that with a just a little change you could run it on Windows, Linux and MacOS, it's main uses are:

 - Game Development
 - Algorithms visualization
 - Experiments and Prototypes.
